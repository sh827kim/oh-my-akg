## The Problem

Operating microservices raises difficult questions — repeatedly:

- Which services are affected by this change?
- Why did a small fix trigger failures elsewhere?
- Is our architecture diagram still aligned with reality?
- Who owns this Kafka topic / DB table / API endpoint?

MSA systems evolve faster than static documents.

**Archi.Navi** addresses this gap by turning your repositories into an
**explorable architecture map** — with approval-based knowledge updates,
Evidence-backed AI Chat, and a graph that reflects reality.

---

## Core Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Object** | The unified unit. Services, API endpoints, databases, tables, topics, queues — all represented as `Object` |
| **Relation** | A typed connection between objects (`call`, `read`, `write`, `produce`, `consume`, `expose`, `depend_on`) |
| **Roll-up View** | A summarized architecture perspective for fast impact analysis (service-to-service, domain-to-domain) |
| **Roll-down View** | Drill-down into a specific object to see atomic-level detail flows |
| **Approval Queue** | Inferred changes are queued first; applied only after approve/reject |
| **Evidence** | Source context (file path, line, excerpt) backing every inferred relation or AI answer |
| **Workspace** | Logical isolation boundary for multi-repo/multi-org expansion |

---

## Key Features

### 1. Service Overview

- Service list with search, tag, and visibility controls
- Alias / Type / Visibility management
- CSV export

### 2. Architecture View

- Layered architecture visualization (Roll-up perspective)
- Layer management with drag-and-drop
- PNG export

### 3. Object Mapping View

- Interactive dependency graph (Roll-up & Roll-down)
- Edge-type filtering (`call`, `read`, `write`, `produce`, `consume`)
- View-level switching: Domain → Service → Atomic

### 4. Approval Workflow

- All inferred relations go to a `PENDING` queue before being applied
- Bulk approve / reject with Evidence review
- Manual override always takes priority over inference

### 5. AI Chat (Evidence-first)

- Architecture Q&A grounded in your actual graph data
- Confidence + Evidence-driven responses
- Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (via Vercel AI SDK)
- No definitive answers without Evidence

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.x LTS
- pnpm 10.x

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/archi-navi.git
cd archi-navi

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local — set AI_API_KEY at minimum
```

### Environment Variables

```env
# DB — PGlite is used by default (no separate install needed)
# Uncomment below to use PostgreSQL instead
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/archinavi

# PGlite data directory (default: .archi-navi/data)
PGLITE_DATA_DIR=.archi-navi/data

# AI provider: openai | anthropic | google
AI_PROVIDER=openai
AI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key
AI_MODEL=gpt-4o

# App
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
```

### Run Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

---

## Available Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev            # Start development server (Next.js + HMR)
pnpm build          # Production build
pnpm test           # Run all tests
pnpm lint           # ESLint
pnpm format         # Prettier formatting
pnpm db:generate    # Generate Drizzle migrations from schema
pnpm db:migrate     # Apply migrations
pnpm db:studio      # Open Drizzle Studio (DB browser)
```

---

## CLI Usage

The CLI is used to scan source code, run inference, and manage data.

```bash
# Scan source code and configuration files
archi-navi scan --path /path/to/project --mode code

# Run relation/domain inference
archi-navi infer --workspace <workspaceId>

# Rebuild rollup graph
archi-navi rebuild-rollup --workspace <workspaceId>

# Export data
archi-navi export --format json --output ./export.json

# Save a snapshot of the current state
archi-navi snapshot
```

Scan modes: `code` | `db` | `config` | `all`

## Inference Engine

Archi.Navi automatically infers relations from your codebase:

| Signal Source | Inferred Relation | Example |
|---------------|------------------|---------|
| HTTP client call | `call` | `RestTemplate.getForObject(...)` |
| API controller | `expose` | `@GetMapping("/api/orders")` |
| Message producer | `produce` | `kafkaTemplate.send("order.created")` |
| Message consumer | `consume` | `@KafkaListener(topics="order.created")` |
| DB SELECT | `read` | JPA Repository, MyBatis XML |
| DB INSERT/UPDATE | `write` | JPA Repository, MyBatis XML |

Domain inference supports two tracks:
- **Track A**: Seed-based — user defines domain names, engine calculates affinity scores
- **Track B**: Seed-less Discovery — Louvain community detection on the relation graph

All inference results go through the **Approval Queue** before being applied.

---

## Data Model

All assets are unified under a single `Object` model:

| Category | Compound | Atomic |
|----------|----------|--------|
| COMPUTE | `service` | `api_endpoint`, `function` |
| STORAGE | `database`, `cache_instance` | `db_table`, `db_view`, `cache_key` |
| CHANNEL | `message_broker` | `topic`, `queue` |

Relations are stored at the atomic level; Roll-up views are derived via materialized computation.
